                        The Elder Scrolls is a series of action role-playing video games primarily developed by Bethesda
                        Game Studios and published by Bethesda Softworks. The series focuses on free-form gameplay in a
                        detailed open world. Morrowind, Oblivion and Skyrim all won Game of the Year awards from
                        multiple outlets.
                        The series has sold more than 58 million copies worldwide.
                        Within the series' fictional universe, each game takes place on the continent of Tamriel. The
                        setting combines pre-medieval real-world elements, such as a powerful Roman-like Empire, with
                        highfantasy medieval tropes, including limited technology, widespread magic use, and the
                        existenceof many mythological creatures. The continent is split into a number of provinces inhabited by
                        humansand popular humanoid fantasy races such as elves, orcs and anthropomorphic animals. A
                        common theme in the lore is that a chosen hero rises to defeat an incoming threat, usually a malevolent
                        being or an antagonistic army.
                        Since debuting with Arena in 1994, the series has produced a total of five main games (of which
                        the last three have each featured two or three expansions) as well as several spin-offs. In
                        2014,a massively multiplayer online role-playing game, The Elder Scrolls Online, was released by
                        Bethesda's affiliated ZeniMax subsidiary ZeniMax Online Studios.

                <h3>The following is a list of games released until 2021</h3>
                <ul>
                    <h3>
                        <li><strong>Before The Elder Scrolls</strong>
                    </h3>

                    Prior to working on The Elder Scrolls series, Bethesda had worked predominantly with sports and
                    action games. In the six years from its founding to Arena's 1994 release, Bethesda had released
                    ten games, six of them sports games,with such titles as Hockey League Simulator, NCAA
                    Basketball: Road to the Final Four ('91/'92 Edition), and Wayne Gretzky Hockey,[4] and the
                    remaining four adaptations from other media,primarily the Terminator series.[4] Bethesda's
                    course changed abruptly when it began its first action role-playing venture. Designer Ted
                    Peterson recalls: "I remember talking to the guys at Sir-Tech who were doing Wizardry VII:
                    Crusaders of the Dark Savant at the time, and them literally laughing at us for thinking we
                    could do it."[5] Ted Peterson worked alongside Vijay Lakshman as one of the initial designers of
                    what was then simply Arena, a "medieval-style gladiator game.</li>
                    <h3>
                        <li><strong>Arena</strong>
                    </h3>

                    Peterson and Lakshman were joined by Julian Lefay who, according to Peterson, "really spear-headed
                    the initial development of the series".[5] Peterson, Lakshman, and LeFay were longtime aficionados
                    of pen-and-paper role-playing games,[5] which greatly influenced the creation of the world of
                    Tamriel.[6] They were also fans of Looking Glass Studios' Ultima Underworld series, their main
                    inspiration for Arena.[5] Initially, Arena was not to be a role-playing game at all. The player, and
                    a team of his fighters, would travel the world, fighting other teams in their arenas until the
                    player became "grand champion" in the world's capital, the Imperial City.[6] Along the way, side
                    quests of a more role-playing nature could be completed. As the process of development progressed,
                    however, the tournaments became less important and the side quests more.[5] Role-playing game
                    elements were added, as it expanded to include cities outside the arenas, and dungeons beyond the
                    cities</li>
                    <h3>
                        <li><strong>Daggerfall</strong>
                    </h3>
                    Work on The Elder Scrolls II: Daggerfall began after Arena's release in March 1994.[8] Ted
                    Peterson was assigned the role of lead game designer.[5] Daggerfall's plot was less clichéd than
                    Arena's and involved a "complex series of adventures leading to multiple resolutions."[5] With
                    Daggerfall, Arena's experience-point-based system was replaced with one rewarding the player for
                    actually role-playing their character.[8] Daggerfall came equipped with an improved character
                    generation engine, one that included a GURPS-influenced class creation system, offering players
                    the chance to create their own classes, and assign their own skills</li>
                    <h3>
                        <li><strong>Battlespire and Redguard</strong>
                    </h3>
                    Following the release of Daggerfall, work began on three separate projects at once: An Elder Scrolls
                    Legend: Battlespire, The Elder Scrolls Adventures: Redguard, and Morrowind. Battlespire, originally
                    titled Dungeon of Daggerfall: Battlespire, was the first of the three to be released,[12] on
                    November 30, 1997.[13] Originally designed as an expansion pack for Daggerfall, it was repackaged as
                    a stand-alone game. Battlespire focused on dungeon romping and offered multiplayer gaming—player
                    versus player deathmatch— the only series title to do so[12] before the release of The Elder Scrolls
                    Online in 2014. Redguard was the second of the three titles to be released, on October 31, 1998.[14]
                    It was a pure action-adventure game inspired by Tomb Raider, Prince of Persia, and the Ultima
                    series.[15] Redguard did not offer the player the chance to create their own character. Instead,
                    players would play the prefabricated "Cyrus the Redguard".[15] Both games did poorly with Bethesda's
                    audience. Players used to the vast open spaces of Daggerfall did not take well to the reduced worlds
                    of Redguard and Battlespire. Based upon its customers' clear desire for massive role-playing game
                    worlds, Bethesda redoubled its efforts to build the next major chapter.[3]

                    <h3>
                        <li><strong>And the list go on and on until 2012</strong>
                    </h3>
                    On May 3, 2012, The Elder Scrolls Online was revealed. The Elder Scrolls Online was released
                    for Windows and macOS on April 4, 2014, with the Xbox One and PlayStation 4 versions
                    initially slated to follow in June 2014 but later delayed until June 9, 2015.[62] The game
                    originally required a subscription to play, but this requirement was dropped on March 17,
                    2015.[63] There is however a subscription service entitled "ESO Plus" which grants access to
                    all current and future downloadable content (DLC). The DLC is otherwise available for
                    individual purchase in the Crown Store. Additionally, the optional subscription grants
                    various perks that allow players to progress slightly faster than a free player, and grants
                    them a payment of 1650 crowns per month.[64] On June 14, 2015, The Elder Scrolls: Legends, a
                    collectible card game, was announced by Bethesda during the Electronic Entertainment Expo
                    2015. It was released on March 9, 2017 for Microsoft Windows and is in beta for Android,
                    iOS, and macOS.</li>
